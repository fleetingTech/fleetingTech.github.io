I was not really happy with my old blog setup. I played around with a bit python and php, even tried to generate xhtml...

While looking for a static site generator I discovered a [cool kid](https://razius.com/articles/ditching-wordpress-and-becoming-one-of-the-cool-kids.html).
While Silviu prefers pelican, a python tool, I went with the 'recommended' jekyll approach.
My understanding is that jekyll is the more streamlined approach. As I am not a webdev, nor intend to become one, Jekyll and its liquid templating seems like a good approach.
